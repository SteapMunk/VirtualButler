# Thoughts and Ideas for server structure

We could use a non-relational database (NoSQL) that would store specifc values for preferences per customer. If data is stored this way, it would be easier to transfer 
to a web3 format since a user's data would already be contained in one place? Would still need to see if this is actually feasible.
