# Thoughts and Ideas for our ai butler

Preferences are categorized by a value assoiciated with a tag. For example, Japanese food = 0.79, Korean food = 0.63, Romance Genre = 0.34. Having a value closer to 1 means
the user would be more likely to choose that option based on previous choices.

We could also have a risk factor that determines how likely a user is to try new things (For example when it comes to ordering food at restaurants: Jayna's_Risk_Factor = 0.63,
Sam's_Risk_Factor = 0.24)

We'll still need to determine how we will make the butler a true ai and how we wish for it to interact with the user. I think it will mostly come down to how it interacts with
these values. 

If you have any other ideas put them here.

(Also if we want to monetize this we could have purchasable cosmetics for our VB. This would mean a lot more work on the art side of things though.)
