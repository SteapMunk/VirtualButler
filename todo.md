# A List of objectives and goals that need to be done.

## Overview:

## Butler
- Conceptualize the scope for the butler  
- Plan what type of data we will want it to process (understanding tags/genres? Relating options to other users' preferences?)
- Main focus for what the butler will be butlering (Movies, restaurants, books, etc)

## Server 
- Decide on how we want to store data (i.e. SQL Database, **NoSQL**, Wallet)  

## Client
- Do we want this as a webapp, phone app, or both? (Phone means we will have to make it at least iphone and android compatible)
- Design ideas for logos, images, etc
- App structure. What will the flow be?
